swordfish
=========

``swordfish`` is a Node.js + ElasticSearch based custom alerting system.

Inspired by Kibana, ``swordfish`` uses ElasticSearch data to create custom notifications when thresholds are breached.

``swordfish`` is very much a work in progress so may not provide full functionality straight away.
