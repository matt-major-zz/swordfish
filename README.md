swordfish
=========

``swordfish`` is an AngularJS & ElasticSearch based custom monitoring system.

Inspired by Kibana, ``swordfish`` uses ElasticSearch data to create custom notifications when thresholds are breached.

``swordfish`` is very much a work in progress so may not provide full functionality straight away.
